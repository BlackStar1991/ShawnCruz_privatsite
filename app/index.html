                            Assets
                            Properties have ready several locations around the world to take your free listings for any
                            luxury property you have.

                            Each location web site is purpose built so every Search Engine will pick up new listings
                            within
                            minutes. This way your customers only have to type in keywords relating to their search for
                            a
                            luxury home and the Search Engine will show the Invest Asset web site applicable to their
                            location they are looking for.

                            Most real estate companies are way too busy with selling their client’s properties to put
                            any
                            effort forth to their web site. Hence, making it difficult for web surfers to find their
                            listings.

                            Now times have changed and we at Investment Assets Properties are thinking of the customer
                            before the business.

                            If you have a property in a location not listed at Investment Assets Properties. Don’t
                            worry. A
                            quick email to us will ensure your location is built to accommodate your listing.

                            Selling your luxury home, condominium or property should not be a painstaking event. It
                            should
                            be easy and stress free and it should be able to be advertised on a global scale for free.

                        <p class="block_teamMembers__informationAboutMemder">Successful businesses know the importance
                            of
                            building and maintaining good working relationships, whether it is with partners, employees,
                            business or trade organizations, the government, media representatives, vendors, consumers,
                            or
                            the community at large. A business must carefully balance the benefits of these
                            interpersonal
                            relationships and should never allow these relationships to blind their judgment especially
                            when
                            it relates to what is in the best interest of the business’s continued success and growth

                            Buying advertising media based on interpersonal relationships is a common mistake made by
                            many
                            small businesses. This strategy throws the business’s strategic marketing plan into the
                            winds of
                            chance in exchange for the warm and fuzzy feelings that come with doing business among
                            friends.
                            However, when the smoke clears the business has made costly advertising expenditures with
                            little
                            or no results and the long term negative effects may not readily be seen. Simply, the
                            marketing
                            / advertising expenditures have been made, the budget may or may not be busted, and the
                            results
                            may be none to little measurable penetration into the business’s target demographic market
                            segment.

                            Is buying media from a friend in the business always bad? No, however in order to choose the
                            most effective media channels a business must first consider the audience or customer it is
                            trying to reach. Developing a strong sense of the target demographics’ buying and shopping
                            patterns, interests and hobbies, entertainment and media choices for example will lend
                            itself a
                            tremendous benefit to making informed media buying choices. Once the advertising business
                            has
                            developed a strong sense of what media channels may prove to be the most effective it should
                            try
                            each a little at a time carefully tracking the results of each. Once this is complete the
                            business will be able to make an educated decision on where to invest its marketing dollars,
                            prioritizing expenditures into the mediums that have proven results for the business.

                            It is true that strong interpersonal relationships skills and the ability to develop and
                            maintain good working relationships with a variety of people, businesses, and other
                            organizations are imperative in today’s business environments. However, the importance of a
                            well
                            designed and implemented strategic marketing plan can not be understated and is paramount to
                            the
                            business’s development and longevity never taking second seat to friendship.</p></div>

                            differ from business to business. Some are designed to display services, whereas others are
                            focused
                            on selling an idea. No matter what the focus of the brochure is, it needs to be readable,
                            intriguing, and functional. The brochure must grab a viewer’s attention and hold it long
                            enough
                            to
                            deliver the pertinent information. How do you grab your customers’ attention with just a
                            piece
                            of
                            paper? You could try by giving the viewer a paper cut, but that’s not the kind of attention
                            you
                            want, is it? Seriously though, with so many brochures out there, how do you stand out? The
                            answer is
                            quite simple. Make sure your brochure is professionally designed, written, and printed. Here
                            are
                            some tips to keep in mind when you hire a freelancer or agency to design your brochure: Text
                            is
                            the
                            key. Anyone can write copy, but only a skilled copywriter can write easy-to-read, strong
                            sentence
                            structures that articulate your company’s message. Wouldn’t you rather go to a specialist?
                            Question
                            all. No matter who is writing your copy, make sure the headline on the front of the brochure
                            is
                            in
                            the form of a question. This question should make the viewer want to open the brochure to
                            learn
                            more. Focus on a problem that is most common in your target industry then tie it directly to
                            a
                            solution you provide your clients. Color matters. Stay in tune with your corporate colors.
                            This
                            will
                            help keep an overall brand image in tact as well as strengthen the brand. Type Issues.
                            Typography
                            should be relevant and thought out. Type is so strong that it can make or break a brochure.
                            Stay
                            away from typical fonts and try to stand out from other brochures in your field. Picture
                            This.
                            If
                            you do not need pictures to articulate a message, then do not use them. Most of the time
                            people
                            are
                            prone to use so many pictures in a brochure, they don’t realize they are clouding their
                            message
                            and
                            making their brochure ineffective. Pictures are great, especially when relevant, but they
                            draw
                            reader’s eyes away from the copy which you have spent so much time perfecting. So, use
                            pictures
                            with
                            taste and if at all possible, don’t use them at all.

                            If you try to cut corners on your brochure you will end up spending more money down the road
                            when
                            you have to get it redesigned. Make sure you do it right the first time, and you will have a
                            brochure that helps you make the biggest return on the investment.</p></div>

                                I want to talk about to things that are quite important to me. There are love and one my
                                personal inadequacies. The thing is that I’m quite fond of love, I think that it’s a
                                pretty
                                all right deal. However, I’m going to have to admit that my emotional baggage has built
                                up
                                walls that not even a shock and awe campaign could bring down. But I do love. And in
                                fact I
                                even love unconditionally.

                                I have a truck. It’s kind of a small truck, but I’m comfortable with myself so that’s
                                okay.
                                I think that I love it. I had a friend about a year ago ask me if I could have any car
                                in
                                the world what would I have. And aside from pointing out that my friend and I have
                                clearly
                                ran out of things to discuss and should probably go our separate ways, my answer told me
                                that I love my truck (obviously I said I would keep my truck). The thing is that its
                                pretty
                                old, almost 10 years. And it seems to attract trouble, it was broken into twice, keyed
                                once
                                and beat with an umbrella by my nephew once. It has no stereo and kind of smells. But
                                when
                                it comes down to it…I just love that thing.

                                I’ll take my truck, new, old, fat, skinny, beat up or shiny. But, I simply couldn’t take
                                it
                                with truck side advertising. Even if someone offered me money, which would mean that my
                                truck would start giving back a little, as opposed to sucking the money out me like a

                                my life that hasn’t been tarnished by the personal inadequacies (that’s actually not

                            things that are quite important to me. There are love and one my personal inadequacies. The
                            thing is that I’m quite fond of love, I think that it’s a pretty all right deal. However,
                            I’m
                            going to have to admit that my emotional baggage has built up walls that not even a shock
                            and
                            awe campaign could bring down. But I do love. And in fact I even love unconditionally.

                            I have a truck. It’s kind of a small truck, but I’m comfortable with myself so that’s okay.
                            I
                            think that I love it. I had a friend about a year ago ask me if I could have any car in the
                            world what would I have. And aside from pointing out that my friend and I have clearly ran
                            out
                            of things to discuss and should probably go our separate ways, my answer told me that I love
                            my
                            truck (obviously I said I would keep my truck). The thing is that its pretty old, almost 10
                            years. And it seems to attract trouble, it was broken into twice, keyed once and beat with
                            an
                            umbrella by my nephew once. It has no stereo and kind of smells. But when it comes down to
                            it…I
                            just love that thing.

                            I’ll take my truck, new, old, fat, skinny, beat up or shiny. But, I simply couldn’t take it
                            with
                            truck side advertising. Even if someone offered me money, which would mean that my truck
                            would
                            start giving back a little, as opposed to sucking the money out me like a leach as it has
                            been;
                            I simply couldn’t handle it. My truck is an individual that puts a smile on my face almost

                        <p class="men-box__phrath">I want to talk about to things that are quite important to me. There
                            are
                            love and one my personal inadequacies. The thing is that I’m quite fond of love, I think
                            that
                            it’s a pretty all right deal. However, I’m going to have to admit that my emotional baggage
                            has
                            built up walls that not even a shock and awe campaign could bring down. But I do love. And
                            in
                            fact I even love unconditionally.

                            I have a truck. It’s kind of a small truck, but I’m comfortable with myself so that’s okay.
                            I
                            think that I love it. I had a friend about a year ago ask me if I could have any car in the
                            world what would I have. And aside from pointing out that my friend and I have clearly ran
                            out
                            of things to discuss and should probably go our separate ways, my answer told me that I love
                            my
                            truck (obviously I said I would keep my truck). The thing is that its pretty old, almost 10
                            years. And it seems to attract trouble, it was broken into twice, keyed once and beat with
                            an
                            umbrella by my nephew once. It has no stereo and kind of smells. But when it comes down to
                            it…I
                            just love that thing.

                            I’ll take my truck, new, old, fat, skinny, beat up or shiny. But, I simply couldn’t take it
                            with
                            truck side advertising. Even if someone offered me money, which would mean that my truck
                            would
                            start giving back a little, as opposed to sucking the money out me like a leach as it has
                            been;
                            I simply couldn’t handle it. My truck is an individual that puts a smile on my face almost
                            whenever I see it. Truck side advertising would simply taint the one thing in my life that
                            hasn’t been tarnished by the personal inadequacies (that’s actually not entirely true, I can
                            feel myself becoming fond of this dog named Luca near my work).</p>
